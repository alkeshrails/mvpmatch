/**Axios
Axios is a promise based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js. 
Axios makes it easy to send asynchronous HTTP requests to REST endpoints and perform CRUD operations. 
It can be used in plain JavaScript or with a library such as Vue or React.

In this tutorial we work with Axios in a Node.js application.

Setting up Axios
First, we install Axios.

$ node -v
v12.20.1
We use Node.js version 12.20.1.

$ npm init -y
We initiate a new Node.js application.

$ npm i axios
